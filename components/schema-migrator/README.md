# Schema Migrator

## Overview

The Schema Migrator is responsible for database schema migrations. It runs all _UP_ migrations one by one as a _post-install/post-upgrade_ K8s job. However, if the Compass installation fails, it must be possible to revert the DB state to what it was before the installation. To do this, a _pre-rollback_ K8s job is responsible for running all new down migrations introduced with the failed installation.

### Rollbacks
The _pre-rollback_ `compass-migration-down` job is rendered from the release, to which you want to roll back. Therefore, the version of the `schema-migrator-down` does not include the new _UP_ and _DOWN_ migrations. For this reason, there is `PersistentVolume` (PV) for preserving the migrations from the _post-install_ `compass-migration` job. For more information about using persistent volume, see [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).

The rollback has the following process flow:
1. The `compass-migration` job replaces the existing migrations in the PV with the migrations from its container.
2. `compass-migration` runs the migrations.
3. When the installation fails, the `compass-migration-down` automatically tries to migrate to the latest available version in its container (this is the version from the previous installation). To do this, the `compass-migration-down` performs the down migrations one by one until the desired state is reached.
    - In case of clean installation, it performs the down migrations one by one, until there are no migrations left. As a result, the DB is cleaned from any migrations.
    - If the desired version does not exist in the PV, the `compass-migration-down` job fails.

## Development

If you want to modify the database schema used by compass, add migration files to `migrations` directory. To do this, see [Migrations](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/blob/master/MIGRATIONS.md).

In case you changed the `schema-migrator` component in your pull request, a new image of the migrator will be produced. It contains all migration files, so make sure that you bump the component version value in the compass chart.

To test if migration files are correct, run:
```
make verify
```
