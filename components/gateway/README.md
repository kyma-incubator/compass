# Gateway

## Overview

Gateway is a component that exposes a service through which it forwards the incoming requests to backing services, such as the Director and Connector. Optionally, Gateway can be configured to send audit logs to the specified logging service.

## Configuration

Gateway binary allows you to override some configuration parameters. You can specify the following basic environment variables:
