## KYMA_VERSION file

`KYMA_VERSION` is the file specifying the version of Kyma to use during the Compass installation.

### Possible values

Since `kyma deploy` is used for Kyma installation, please refer to the valid KYMA_VERSIONS values from the official [Kyma CLI](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli/blob/2.0.4/docs/gen-docs/kyma_deploy.md#flags) documentation under `--source` flag
