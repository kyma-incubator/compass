The following table lists Kyma components files based on the type of Compass installation:

| File                                	   | Description                                                	          |

| `kyma-components-minimal.yaml` 	        | Kyma components that are required for minimal Compass installation. 	 |

## KYMA_VERSION File

`KYMA_VERSION` is the file specifying the version of Kyma to use during the Compass installation.

### Possible Values

Since `kyma deploy` is used for Kyma installation, please refer to the valid KYMA_VERSIONS values from the official [Kyma CLI](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli/blob/2.0.4/docs/gen-docs/kyma_deploy.md#flags) documentation under `--source` flag
