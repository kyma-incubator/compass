# Establishing trusted connection

The following document describes flow that needs to be performed to establish trusted connection between [Application](../terminology.md#application), [Managemen Plane](../terminology.md#management-plane), and [Runtime](../terminology.md#runtime). Currently trusted relation is confirmed by client certificate that is generated by [Connector](../terminology.md#mp-connector).

## Client certificate flow

This diagram shows the sequence of API calls that allows the Application or Runtime to establish trusted connection using client certificate.

> **NOTE:** All API calls to the Connector require valid one-time token that can be also obtained from Connector API.

The external system (Application / Runtime) requests from Connector detailed information
required to generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR). In the response Connector also returns new one-time token that should be used when sending the CSR API call.

The external system generates a CSR based on infromation provided by Connector and sends the CSR to the Connector. In the response, the exteral system receives a signed certificate. It can use the certificate to authenticate the further communication between Management Plane, Runtimes and Applications.
