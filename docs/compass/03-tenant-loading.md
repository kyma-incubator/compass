# Tenant loading

There are two ways in which Compass loads a list of tenants:
- Initial loading of the default tenants that occurs after the chart installation
- Manual loading of tenants provided in a ConfigMap

## Initial tenant loading

There are three default tenants predefined for Compass:
- `default`
- `foo`
- `bar`

The list of default tenants is specified in the **global.tenants** parameter in the [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/kyma-incubator/compass/blob/master/chart/compass/values.yaml) file. You can modify this list by providing appropriate overrides.
 
The `compass-director-tenant-loader-default` job that loads the list of default tenants is executed only once after the installation of the Compass chart. It is enabled by default. To disable it, set **global.tenantConfig.useDefaultTenants** to `false`. 


## Manual tenant loading

You can load external tenants manually at any time by following these steps:

1. Create the `compass-director-external-tenant-config` ConfigMap with an embedded JSON file that contains tenants to add. See the example:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: compass-director-external-tenant-config
     namespace: compass-system
   data:
     tenants.json: |-
       [
         {
           "name": "tenant-name-1",
           "id": "tenant-id-1"
         },
         {
           "name": "tenant-name-2",
           "id": "tenant-id-2"
         }
       ]
   ```

2. Create a job that loads tenants from the provided ConfigMap by using the suspended `compass-director-tenant-loader-external` CronJob as a template: 

    ```sh
    kubectl -n compass-system create job --from=cronjob/compass-director-tenant-loader-external compass-director-tenant-loader-external
    ```
3. Wait for the job to finish adding tenants.
4. Delete the manually created job and ConfigMap from the cluster.
