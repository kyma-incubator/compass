# Documentation

## Overview

The `docs` folder contains end-to-end documentation on Compass and its components.

Start with the overarching Compass documentation where you can find the general information on Compass. The documents are arranged in the fixed order that follows the [content strategy](https://kyma-project.io/community/guidelines/content/#content-strategy-content-strategy-documentation-types). Then, read about the components in more detail:
* [Connector](./connector)
* [Integration System](./integration-system)
* [Provisioner](./provisioner)
* [Runtime Agent](./runtime-agent)

### Docs structure

The directory has the following structure:

```
