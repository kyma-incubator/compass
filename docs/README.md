# Documentation

## Overview

The `docs` folder contains end-to-end documentation on Compass and its components.

Start with the overarching [Compass](./compass) documentation where you can find general information on Compass. The documents are arranged in the fixed order that follows the [Kyma Community](https://kyma-project.io/community/guidelines/content/#content-strategy-content-strategy-documentation-types) content strategy. Then, read about the components in more detail:
* [Connector](./connector)
* [Director](./director)
* [Integration System](./integration-system)
* [Runtime Agent](./runtime-agent)
* [System Broker](./system-broker)
* [System Fetcher](./system-fetcher)
* [Asynchronous Operations Controller](./operations-controller)

## Development

Follow these basic rules when you add a new document to the official documentation:

1. Get familiar with the [Content Strategy](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/main/docs/guidelines/content-guidelines/01-content-strategy.md) to learn about the official approach to content development.
2. Follow the general contribution rules and process. See [Contributing Rules](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/main/docs/contributing/02-contributing.md).
3. Make use of the templates to structure your documents properly. See [Document Types Templates](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/main/docs/guidelines/templates/templates-type.md).
4. Be compliant with the writing guidelines to contribute high-quality and standardized content. See [Content Guidelines](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/main/docs/guidelines/content-guidelines).
