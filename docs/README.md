# Documentation

## Overview

The `docs` folder contains end-to-end documentation on Compass and its components.

Start with the overarching [Compass documentation](./compass) where you can find general information on Compass. The documents are arranged in the fixed order that follows the [content strategy](https://kyma-project.io/community/guidelines/content/#content-strategy-content-strategy-documentation-types). Then, read about the components in more detail:
* [Connector](./connector)
* [Director](./director)
* [Integration System](./integration-system)
* [Runtime Agent](./runtime-agent)
* [Runtime Provisioner](./runtime-provisioner)

### Docs structure

The directory has the following structure:

```

## Development

Follow these basic rules when you add a new document to the official documentation:

1. Get familiar with the [Content Strategy](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/guidelines/content-guidelines/01-content-strategy.md) to learn about the official approach to content development.
2. Follow the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/contributing/02-contributing.md) for the general contribution rules and process.
3. Make use of the [templates](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/guidelines/templates) to structure your documents properly.
4. Be compliant with the writing [guidelines](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/master/guidelines/content-guidelines) to contribute high-quality and standardized content.
