# Default eventing for application


Director, as the main component which manages the information for Applications and Runtimes, is also responsible for providing eventing configurations. The following document describes the process of determining which Runtime should be configured to process the Applications' events.

>**NOTE:** Currently, only one Runtime can receive events from the Application.

An application can obtain the eventing configuration from the Director's API using the `application(id: ID!): Application`. The `Application` type offers the **eventingConfiguration** property that holds the **defaultURL** property with the URL to the eventing backend.
If the value of the **defaultURL** parameter is an empty string, it means that there is no Runtime assigned that can process the Application events.

## Determining default Runtime for the Application events

When querying **eventingConfiguration** for the `Application` type, the Director component tries to determine the default Runtime that will process the events.

In the first step, it searches for a Runtime that belongs to one of the Application's scenarios and has the `{APPLICATION_ID}_defaultEventing = true` label assigned. If there is no such Runtime, the Director looks for the oldest Runtime that is assigned to the Application's scenarios. After finding the oldest Runtime, it is labeled with the `{APPLICATION_ID}_defaultEventing = true` label and next time, it will be treated as the default one. Having the default Runtime determined, the Director component fetches its eventing URL and returns as **defaultURL** for the **eventingConfiguration**.

When the Director is unable to find the default Runtime, the **defaultURL** for the **eventingConfiguration** is an empty string.

## Changing the default Runtime assigned for the Application eventing

The Director API offers a mutation that allows for assigning the default Runtime for the Application eventing. The `setDefaultEventingForApplication(appID: String!, runtimeID: String!): ApplicationEventingConfiguration!` mutation verifies whether the given Runtime belongs to the Application's scenarios and labels it with the `{APPLICATION_ID}_defaultEventing = true` label. If the Application had previously assigned default Runtime, the label from that Runtime is removed.

## Deleting the default Runtime assigned for the Application eventing

The Directors API offers a mutation that allows for deleting the assignment of the default Runtime for the Application eventing. The `deleteDefaultEventingForApplication(appID: String!): ApplicationEventingConfiguration!` mutation deletes the `{APPLICATION_ID}/defaultEventing = true` label from the labeled Runtime.

>**NOTE:** After deleting the `{APPLICATION_ID}_defaultEventing = true` label and querying for the **eventingConfiguration** for the Application, the Director API determines the default Runtime for the Application once again.
