# Automatic status update

Applications and Runtimes in the Director use the `Status` field to inform the user about their condition. When a paired Application or Runtime communicates with the Director API for the first time, the Director automatically sets its status to **CONNECTED**. You can also manage statuses manually by updating the objects.
